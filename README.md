# Blackjack

Learning how to code on Android by porting the Blackjack game made in Java over.

Main issues were that resources could only be gotten from an activity or context needed to be passed, so some files had to be changed to accomodate.

Scaling also took me a while so it looked alright on different devices (tested on Emulated Nexus 5 and own Galaxy J1 Ace)

Need to document code

Could still add a dialog box if the user tries to input a bet out of intended range, and still need to add a reset button. Overall it was a fun experience.
